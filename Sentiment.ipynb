       "> The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been asked for centuries. There is no single answer that is universally agreed upon, as the meaning of life is subjective and personal to each individual. However, there are many different perspectives on the meaning of life, including:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **The pursuit of happiness:** Some people believe that the meaning of life is to be happy. This could mean pursuing personal goals, spending time with loved ones, or simply enjoying the present moment.\n",
       "> * **The fulfillment of one's potential:** Others believe that the meaning of life is to fulfill one's potential. This could mean pursuing a career, achieving a goal, or simply becoming the best version of oneself.\n",
       "> * **The service of others:** Many people find meaning in life through service to others. This could mean volunteering, donating to charity, or simply helping out friends and family.\n",
       "> * **The quest for knowledge:** Some people find meaning in life through the pursuit of knowledge. This could mean studying a particular subject, reading books, or exploring new ideas.\n",
       "> * **The connection to something greater than oneself:** Many people find meaning in life through their connection to something greater than themselves. This could be a religious faith, a spiritual practice, or simply a sense of belonging to the universe.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Ultimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must discover for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and the meaning of life can change over time. The important thing is to find something that gives your life purpose and makes you feel fulfilled."

This scattering causes the blue light to be more visible and gives the sky its blue color. This effect is known as Rayleigh scattering.\""

swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it setting to decide whether touching the screen for recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for year now and they still haven adding this

being refurbished planning on getting another one for the amazon fire stick in bedroom\",\"pred_label\":\"\"},{\"clean_reviews\":\"works very well for amazon and netflix but will not let all viewing platforms like vudu it also will shut down if hulu is played for more than couple minutes and yes have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue even checked outlet voltage an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is user friendly platform to use if they would fix those two issues would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one to bad to because relay like amazon products and having alexa is always nice\",\"pred_label\":\"\"},{\"clean_reviews\":\"haven had it

but had to work through the bugs\",\"pred_label\":\"\"},{\"clean_reviews\":\"when got this echo was excited to have device with better sound than my dot and hub to control some hue bulbs what didn realize and also wasn fully communicated to me is that you can use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is security concern for me do not buy this if you want full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device only disappointed with the hub functionalities\",\"pred_label\":\"\"},{\"clean_reviews\":\"never could get it to work techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn strong enough to power it
